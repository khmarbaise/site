Based on often written requirements (mailing list, stackoverflow.com etc.) and an <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-1563">Jira entry</a> i have decided to start a guide about unit- and integration tests. This guide is called <b>Maven Unit- and Integration Test Guide (MaUI Guide for short)</b> and the current state of development can be found on <a href="http://khmarbaise.github.com/maui/">http://khmarbaise.github.com/maui/</a>. The currently generated <a href="http://khmarbaise.github.com/maui/">guide</a> can be used as reference  where you can read how to do unit- and/or integration testing. Of course if you find things unclear or would like to see supplemental things in there just file in a <a href="https://github.com/khmarbaise/maui/issues">issue in the issue tracker of the github project</a>.
