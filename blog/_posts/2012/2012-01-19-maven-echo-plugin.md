A small problem, but always the suggestion to use Maven-AntRun plugin...But i changed it and created a small simple maven-plugin to solve that. The <a href="http://site.supose.org/maven-echo-plugin/">Maven-Echo-Plugin</a> which can be used to print out some informative messages during a Maven build...If you have any suggestions for improvements don't hesitate to contact me or just file in an issue on <a href="https://github.com/khmarbaise/Maven-Echo-Plugin">github</a>.
